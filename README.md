# MML---Adult-Income-Dataset
Investigation over the Adult Income dataset, in order to develop a classification model over it
The code is contained in the Jupiter Notebook here called "MML Tesina Fabio Tatti". 
All the insights about the various steps, from the data exploration to the final evaluation of the various models, are described in the Report file "MML Report Fabio Tatti".

Since this work was born for the exam for the course "Mathematics in Machine Learning" from the M. Sc. Data Science and Engineering of the Polytechninc of Turin, 
the main focus was about the whole pipeline of the project and the testing of various models.
